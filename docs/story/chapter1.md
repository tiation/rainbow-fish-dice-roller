# Rainbow Fish Story

The Rainbow Fish's journey is a tale of beauty, sharing, and transformation. Our project draws parallels from this narrative to illustrate the evolution of coding styles.

## Chapter 1: The Beginning
Once upon a time, in the deep sea, there lived a fish with shiny, multi-colored scales.

## Chapter 2: The Journey
While the world around him evolved, so did the Rainbow Fish. Each scale represents a mosaic of old and new coding paradigms.
