# Rainbow Fish Dice Roller

Welcome to the Rainbow Fish Dice Roller, an initiative led by Garrett Dillman. This project embodies the evolution from a simple, nostalgic dice rolling application to a sophisticated, enterprise-grade tool designed to meet modern standards.

## Project Vision

Garrett Dillman envisioned the Rainbow Fish Dice Roller as more than just a utility; it's a testament to how classic practices meet innovative technology. While capturing the simplicity of vanilla JavaScript coding from the 90s, it is integrated with state-of-the-art devops workflows using Helm, ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use, no-frills, and visually engaging interface reminiscent of the 90s.
- **Multiple Configurations:** Provides options for DnD enthusiasts and dungeon masters to roll and track dice.
- **Modern Tooling:** Integration with modern tools like npm ensures an efficient build process.
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Designed with scalability and modularity to fit enterprise level needs.
